# Online Learning Platform Development

This project was developed for the "Fundamentals of Software Project Management" course.

Our team successfully planned, tracked, and delivered the "Online Learning Platform Development" within the set timeline (Oct 17, 2025 â€“ Apr 15, 2026), meeting all objectives and quality standards.

We effectively managed and monitored the project using MS Project, ensuring on-time completion, proper resource allocation, and adherence to project management principles.  
The result is a fully functional, scalable, and user-friendly platform for online education.
